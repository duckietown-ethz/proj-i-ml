Machine learning based lane following.

The goal of the project is to implement a machine learning based lane following algorithm on a [Duckiebot](https://www.duckietown.org/).
This repo contains all files which we used to complete the project. 

We split the project into three different part:
* Data acquisition and labling
* Training of the CNN
* Implementation on the Duckiebot

In the following is a short summery of the folders.
## [data_sets](data_sets)
Labeled data sets

## [data_acquisition](data_acquisition)
The whole data acquisition pipline, i.e., how to acquire, process and labeled the data.

## [training](training)

#  Data labeling

## Setup
This module adds labels to our previous collected data.
Before the module can be executed, we need data to work with which is saved in a specific way. 
Specifically, the processed trajectory files, created by the watchtowers are needed. 
These files are stored in the 'trajectoryFiles' folder. These can be one or multiple split ‘.yaml’ files, which are named the same way as the folder they are in. For example if the folder is called ‘autobot04_r2’, the trajectory .yaml files need to be called autobot04_r2_0.yaml, autobot04_r2_1.yaml. What is also needed is a ‘image_timestamps.csv’ file. 
This contains the frames taken from the Duckiebot video stream bag files and their timestamp. A representation can be seen here:

+ trajectoryFiles
  + autobot04
    + autobot04_0.yaml
    + autobot04_1.yaml
    + autobot04_2.yaml
    + image_timestamps.csv
  + autobot05
    + autobot05_0.yaml
    + autobot05_1.yaml
    + autobot05_2.yaml
    + image_timestamps.csv

## Explanation
The module reads in the pose for every timestep of the trajectory that was generated by the watchtowers. Specifically, the position and it's heading. It then matches the timesteps and poses to the timestamps of each image of the rosbags. If the timesteps are not exactly the same, the pose is interpolated to match the timestamp of the image frames. 

## Visualizing the trajectory
The trajectory can be visualized with the jupyter notebook TrajectoryVisualization.ipynb. To start the notebook, open the terminal, execute the command `$ jupyter notebook` and open the notebook. Depending on the map the recording was made on, change the map name from *robotarium2* to the desired map. The available maps can be found in the`<Duckietown-World>` : <https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-world/tree/daffy/visualization/maps> repository. Change the name of the desired folders where the trajectory .yaml files are saved at the folderNamesSingle variable. The TrajectoryVisualizaiton notebook provides an animated visualization of the Duckiebot for each timestep.
